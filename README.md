### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- Header tag is for repeating content across a site, not page specific content.
- It's better for performance to link fonts in the HTML head
- Em should be used when you specifically want a property to scale with that element's font size.
- Reinforced my understanding of grid and how I can achieve complex designs with grid rows and columns

### Continued development

I want to learn more about grid (ex:grid-template-areas)

### Useful resources

- [Grid Crash Course](https://youtu.be/0xMQfnTU6oo?si=i07ipMaQEAvLv83H) - This video helped me to understand how to span rows and columns in grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
